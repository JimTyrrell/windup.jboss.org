%h1 Take the guesswork out of migrations
:markdown
  Windup is a tool to simplify Java application migrations. The tool analyzes application artifacts (such as Java code, JSPs and XML) and produces an HTML report highlighting areas that require changes. The analyzer is driven by customizable and extendable rules to provide as much information as required to assist developers in migrating applications. Its initial focus is Java EE application migrations (from Websphere and Weblogic to JBoss EAP) but the Windup design and rule organization is general enough to allow Windup to be used for practically any kind of migration and any language.

%h1 How does it work?
:markdown
  Windup is comprised of resource interrogators. These interrogators look for common resources and highlight technologies and known “trouble spots” in migrating applications. The goal of Windup is to provide a high level view into relevant technologies in use within the application, and provide a consumable report for organizations to estimate, document, and migrate JEE applications to JBoss.
  
  Below is a list of the interrogators included with JBoss Windup:

%table.table.table-striped.table-bordered
  %thead
    %tr
      %th Interrogators
      %th Description
  %tbody
    %tr
      %td Java Interrogator
      %td Reads compiled Java files; determined if blacklisted classes are imported, and if so it will continue to profile the resource.
    %tr
      %td JSP Interrogator
      %td Reads JSP files; extracts JSP import and taglibs in use and continues to profile the resource.
    %tr
      %td XML Interrogator
      %td Reads XML files; reads the XML into a DOM object and continues to profile the resource.
